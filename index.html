        <p>As a former Pharmacist, I saw the potential in how technology could transform the industry I was in. I first started learning coding to customise my ecommerce website, but after dabbling in it for about two years I've came to realise coding is where my interest lies.
        <br>
        <br>
        That's when I decided to take on a 12-week Web Development Course at General Assembly where I learned all the essentials to become a full-stack web developer. It could be the satisfaction of solving problems or the ability to create and design, but I always enjoy coding till late at night, or even on the weekends.
        <br>

        I have been an avid gamer since I was a child. I enjoy playing games because I can immerse myself in worlds beyond imagination, enjoy the adrenaline rush from winning a close match, become comrades with strangers over the world and share my experience with others through streaming on Twitch.
        As a person that 'lives on the internet', I think it is pure bliss that I can do what I love for a living, and I would love to use my new found skills to improve peopleâ€™s lives.
